# nutritionapp
NOTE: Our codebase has migrated to the csci/187Nutrition/MealPlanner repository to accommodate the android app file directories. 

https://github.com/csci187Nutrition/MealPlanner

I was unable to figure out a way to keep this repository's branches/commits and replace the master branch with the android app directories, so resorted to making a new repository. I have left this original repo as is so that its commit history is available to view. - Andrew
